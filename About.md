I was born and raised in Rwanda, where I studied and worked till 2004. Then I migrated to Belgium before coming to the United States. My academic and professional pursuits have been characterized with a profound passion for art, literature, communication, media, and technologies.

My educational journey led me to the University of Michigan, where I graduated in 2021. However, my path to this institution was made possible by the UROP program. It was through the Community College Summer Research Fellowship in 2018 that I had my first taste of research, and this invaluable opportunity paved the way for my transfer to the University of Michigan from a community college.

During my time as an undergraduate at UofM, I had the privilege of further exploring research through programs such as Changing Gears and Research Scholar/UROP. These experiences were instrumental in shaping my academic and personal growth. I am forever grateful for the UROP program, which provided me with a sense of belonging within the Umich community and became like a second family to me.

Now, I have returned to the University of Michigan to pursue a Master's Degree in Information, I expect to graduate in 2025. It is with great honor that I take on the role of Graduate Student Coordinator in the UROP program. In this capacity, I will have the opportunity to work closely with students enrolled in Changing the Gears. I will be responsible for organizing seminars alongside Peer Facilitators and serving as a liaison between student researchers and their mentors.
